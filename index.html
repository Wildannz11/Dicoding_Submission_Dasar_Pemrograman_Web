                            <h4>The Deshaun Watson settlement shows the NFL has made progress with sexual misconduct accusations. Will anything change?</h4>
                            <img src="assets/image/news1.jpg" class="featured-images" alt="news1" title="news1">
                            <p>(CNN)Over a decade ago, Ben Roethlisberger was accused of sexually assaulting a college student in Georgia -- a case that sent shudders through the NFL world.
                                Roethlisberger, the starting quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers at the time, was beloved by fans -- having led the Steelers to two Super Bowl championships.
                                Though Roethlisberger was never charged with any crimes, he was given a six-game suspension by the league for violating its personal conduct policy. (Roethlisberger's lawyer denied the sexual assault allegation, and the quarterback apologized in a statement to the team and fans for letting them down). Later, the suspension was reduced to four games for good behavior.

                            <p>(CNN)The father of Duke women's volleyball player Rachel Richardson says his daughter was "afraid" and phoned him in tears after being subjected to racist abuse during a match against Brigham Young University on Friday.
                                Richardson, who is Black, is a sophomore outside hitter for Duke. She tweeted a statement Sunday explaining she was not the only player who was the target of the racist slurs and heckling at BYU's Smith Fieldhouse in Provo, Utah.</p>

                        <p>(CNN)Karim Benzema scored two late goals as Real Madrid beat against Espanyol on Sunday to maintain its perfect start to the La Liga season.

                            The game looked to be heading towards a draw after Vin√≠cius Jr.'s opener was canceled out by Joselu in the first-half, but Benzema was on hand to settle the tie in a thrilling finale.
                            The Frenchman volleyed in Rodrygo's cross at the back post to give his side the lead in the 88th minute before settling the match with a free-kick in the 10th minute of added time.</p>
